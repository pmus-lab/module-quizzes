      {
        "answer": "SVCs do not use a kernel.",
        "correct": true,
        "feedback": "Correct! SVCs create a linear boundary, while SVMs use kernels to handle more complex relationships."
      },
      {
        "answer": "SVCs always use a radial kernel.",
        "correct": false,
        "feedback": "Incorrect. SVMs use kernels like the radial kernel; SVCs are fundamentally linear."
      },
      {
        "answer": "SVCs always use a polynomial kernel.",
        "correct": false,
        "feedback": "Incorrect. Polynomial kernels are used by SVMs, not SVCs."
      },
      {
        "answer": "SVCs cannot use soft margins.",
        "correct": false,
        "feedback": "Incorrect. The concept of a soft margin (allowing violations of the hyperplane) is a core part of the SVC."

      {
        "answer": "Enlarging",
        "correct": true,
        "feedback": "Correct! SVMs lift data into higher dimensions (e.g., using squared features) to find separation."
      },
      {
        "answer": "Reducing",
        "correct": false,
        "feedback": "Incorrect. Reducing the feature space would lose information; SVMs add dimensions to find boundaries."

    "answers": [
      {
        "answer": "The parameter is called d.",
        "correct": false,
        "feedback": "Incorrect. The degree d is associated with the polynomial kernel."
      },
      {
        "answer": "The parameter is called gamma.",
        "correct": true,
        "feedback": "Correct! Gamma is the primary tuning parameter for the radial kernel."

      {
        "answer": "The parameter value is determined by cross-validation.",
        "correct": true,
        "feedback": "Correct! Tuning parameters for kernels are typically found using CV."

      {
        "answer": "The parameter is determined by the number of support vectors.",
        "correct": false,

    "question": "True or False: The 'kernel trick' refers to the ability of SVMs to calculate high-dimensional relationships by transforming the data into higher dimensions.",

      {
        "answer": "True",
        "correct": false,
        "feedback": "False. The 'trick' is that it calculates these similarities without actually performing the transformation."

      {
        "answer": "False",
        "correct": true,
